LUMCON Oceandotcomm 2018 

## Developed by Megan Hepner, Paige Byerly, and Bethann Garramon Merkle 
The [Saltmarsh interactive infographic](https://mhepner90.github.io/LUMCON_ODOTCOMM18/saltmarsh.html) and article published in [American Scientist](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/renewed-hope-for-coastal-marshes-in-louisiana) were developed as a result of [OCEANDOTCOMM](https://lumcon.edu/oceandotcomm/), an ocean science communication event supported by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON). The interactive infographic was generated using the Infographiq package (Best B., 2017) developed by the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) for the creation of interactive infographics for data-driven storytelling. The infographic was developed by Merkle, with use of vector images from IAN (ian.umces.edu/imagelibrary/).
