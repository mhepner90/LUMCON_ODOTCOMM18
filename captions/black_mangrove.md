Black mangrove, a woody, subtropical shrub, is at the northernmost part of its range in Louisiana, where it has a patchy distribution in coastal marsh and on barrier islands. This shrub is intolerant to freezing, and its spread has been historically held in check by periodic cold weather events. As the climate in Louisiana warms, black mangrove is expanding its range, and it is predicted to greatly increase its distribution in the future.
Black mangrove is a natural member of the Gulf of Mexico coastal marsh ecosystem. It provides habitat for many saltmarsh species, including nesting birds like marsh wrens, orchard orioles, and brown pelicans. It also helps buffer coastal marshes and barrier islands against storm damage, helping to reduce land loss to erosion. However, black mangrove expansion may also have some negative consequences for the coastal marsh ecosystem. Because mature black mangrove can block the sun from reaching the ground, it has the potential to outcompete important marsh plants like smooth cordgrass. If smooth cordgrass declines as a result, there may be negative consequences for grass-dependent species like periwinkle snails and seaside sparrows. Additionally, shrimp and blue crab have been found to be less abundant in mangrove-dominated marshes, indicating that the black mangrove expansion in Louisiana may have important long-term ramifications for the state’s fisheries.
