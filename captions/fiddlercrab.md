## Fiddler Crab (*Minuca* spp.) 
Louisiana saltmarshes are home to several species of fiddler crabs of the *Minuca* genus. Fiddler crabs are saltmarsh ecosystem engineers, shaping the environment around them. They live in large colonies, and their densely crowded burrows help aerate the soil, which marsh grasses need for respiration. Fiddler crabs eat bacteria and decaying plant material, helping keep marsh waters clean. Theyâ€™re also an important food source for many species, including roseate spoonbills and raccoons.

Abundance and population trends are unknown for this foundational saltmarsh species, representing an opportunity for valuable future research.
