**Fiddler Crab (*Minuca* spp.)**

Louisiana’s coastal marshes are home to several species of fiddler crabs of the *Minuca* (formerly *Uca*) genus. Fiddler crabs are marsh ecosystem engineers that shape the environment around them. They live in large colonies, and their densely crowded burrows help aerate the soil. The oxygen the crabs draw into the soil aids respiration of marsh grasses and other plants. Fiddler crabs eat bacteria and decaying plant material, helping keep marsh waters clean. They’re also an important food source for many species.

A study conducted following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill found that fiddler crab burrow density and diameter were both reduced in oiled versus unoiled coastal marsh sites, and that species composition similarly declined. Fiddler crab populations appeared to have fully recovered by 2013. However, results from this study indicate that oil spills have the potential to greatly affect coastal marsh ecosystem functioning by suppressing populations of foundational species like fiddler crabs.
