## Diamondback Terrapin (*Malaclemys terrapin*)  
The diamondback terrapin is the only turtle in the world that lives in saltmarsh. They are a species of greatest conservation concern in Louisiana, due in part to their past history as a key ingredient in turtle soup. Current threats include coastal land loss and human activity at nest sites. 

Abundance and population trends are unknown for this unique saltmarsh species, representing an opportunity for valuable future research.
