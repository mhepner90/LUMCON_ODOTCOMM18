The [Saltmarsh interactive infographic](https://mhepner90.github.io/LUMCON_ODOTCOMM18/saltmarsh.html) and article published in American Scientist were developed as a result of [OCEANDOTCOMM](https://lumcon.edu/oceandotcomm/), an ocean science communication event supported by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON). The interactive infographic was generated using the [*Infographiq*](https://github.com/bbest/infographiq) package (Best B., 2017) developed by the [Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON)](http://sanctuaries.marinebon.org/) for the creation of interactive infographics for data-driven storytelling. The infographic was developed by Merkle, with use of vector images from [IAN](ian.umces.edu/imagelibrary/).
